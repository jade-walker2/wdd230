        <p class="fox-paragraph">I chose one of my favorite brands, Fox Racing. Fox always has a very cool website. I chose Visual Balance
            for this website because I think the website shows good visual balance. Visual balance to me means the
            the website has good picture size, text size, topography, and good layout. In web design we need to have
            good Visual Balance.

        <p class="pit-viper-paragraph">I chose yet another one of my favorite brands, Pit Viper. Pit Viper definetly
            has a very unique background, but yet it is very consistent. I think that it is consistent by being the
            same in layout for each item they are selling. I think it is very good to have a consistent website so that
            your customers can know how to use it better.

        <p class="idaho-paragraph">I chose the Visit Idaho Website because I think it shows really good color.
            To me, having good color in a website is making sure that your color schema matches and flows well
            together. If your colors are all over the place it is kind of hard to tell what is going on.
